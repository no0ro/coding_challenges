// Prompt: Create a function createFunctionWithInput that accepts one input and returns a function. When that created function is called, it should return the input that was passed to createFunctionWithInput when it was created.
// const sampleFunc = createFunctionWithInput('sample');
// const helloFunc = createFunctionWithInput('hello');
// // Now we'll call the functions we created and log the result
// console.log(sampleFunc()); 
// // should log 'sample' to the console
// console.log(helloFunc());
// // should log 'hello' to the console
