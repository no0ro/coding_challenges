/* PROMPT

Write a function that takes two inputs, a base and an exponent, 
and returns the expected value of base ^ exponent. 
For instance, if our base is 2 and our exponent is 3, then return 8 because 2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8.

Input 1: {Number} base - base number raised to the exponent
Input 2: {Number} exponent - exponent the base is raised to
Output: {Number} - expected
